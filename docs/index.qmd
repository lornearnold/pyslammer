## Welcome to pySLAMMER's documentation
pySLAMMER (**Py**thon package for **S**eismic **L**andslide **M**ovement **M**odeled using **E**arthquake **R**ecords) is tool for estimating the co-seismic displacements of landslides with rigid and flexible sliding-block analyses. The package name and code are based on the USGS tool [SLAMMER](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/12b1/) by @jibson2013.

pySLAMMER includes the following sliding block models:

-   Rigid (i.e., traditional Newmark analysis [@newmark1965] as implemented by @jibson1993).

-   Decoupled (per @makdisi1978)

-   Coupled (described by @chopra1991 and modified by @rathje1999)
