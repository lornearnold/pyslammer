# Verification

Additionally, where available, analytical solutions provide another point verification. While analytical solutions to sliding block analyses are not possible for complex ground motions, they can be developed for simple harmonic motions and pulses @conte1989.

The following sections compare pySLAMMER's results to the legacy SLAMMER program results for a suite of recorded ground motions as well as analytical results for harmonic ground motions. For equivalent linear options for coupled analysis, the computational performance of pySLAMMER and SLAMMER are also compared.
