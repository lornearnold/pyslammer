# Verification
The verifications should include:

1. A comparison of SLAMMER and pySLAMMER's results (rigid, decoupled, and coupled)
2. A comparison of (1) with an analytical solution (rigid only)
3. Possibly some trends from publications? I think that's probably better suited for the [Examples](examples.qmd) section.
